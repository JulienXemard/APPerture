**We chose to work in a pair** because our previous project raised the difficulties to work in group which is a point we wanted to be prepared for.  Therefore, we decided to exposed ourselves to the market reality and the collaboration requirements.  Subsequently, the planning and attribution of tasks was essential to us which allowed to keep this project objectives clear.
