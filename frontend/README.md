**We chose to work in a pair** because our previous project raised the difficulties to work in group which is a point we wanted to be prepared for.  Therefore, we decided to exposed ourselves to the market reality and the collaboration requirements.  Subsequently, the planning and attribution of tasks was essential to us which allowed to keep this project objectives clear.

**The project idea rapidly took form** as we both had a similar vision on the final render & UX.  
With no previous experience or knowledge on the concept, we decided to use **React-Spring** to render some **parallax** effects! Factorising it to our project was such a challenge but we firmly believe that this pain took our idea to the next level. Our appreciation for photography was the starting point of our brain storming and led to us to revisit a market reference App: Instagram. Excited by some of its functionalities, we decided to challenge ourselves and work our project around them.

Establishing the Relationship Diagram & setting up our Backend accordingly was the very first obstacle.

<br />

The logic related to the ‘Following - Follower’ gave us a hard time! With some help, we came up with a solution that made this challenge mentally rewarding.

**ReactJS gave us food for thoughts** as we wanted to use another technology than Bulma (previous project).
<br />
Intrigued by the substantial functionalities and the documentation of Material UI, we had to allocate some time to verify that our current knowledge would allow us to implement it. Material UI requires React Hooks which was only optional in our brief. Our decision was risky but the learning curve is what mattered most to us, therefore we settled on Material UI along with React Hooks.
